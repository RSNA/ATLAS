# ATLAS

__Annotated Library of AI Systems__

ATLAS is the library of AI models and datasets hosted by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). Information about each model or dataset is stored as a JSON-language "card" on the ATLAS site, where it is indexed by title, keywords, and radiology subspecialty content codes.

Information contained within each card is based on the [ROADMAP](../ROADMAP/README.md) ontology, a controlled
vocabulary that standardizes the terms used to describe AI models and datasets. ROADMAP includes synonyms,
abbreviations, and defintions of the terms.  

## JSON Schema

The following documents define the content of ATLAS cards for AI models and datasets (version 2025-11):

* [Models](model.json)
* [Datasets](dataset.json)

The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) is a non-profit organization of more than 54,00 members
that represents professionals
spanning the full breadth of radiologic subspecialties in more than 160 countries around the world.
